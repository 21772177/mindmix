## 🎯 What's Working Now

### Authentication System
```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"user@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"pass1234"}'

# Get user info (with token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:4000/auth/me
```

### Challenge Generation
```bash
# Get challenges (works with or without OpenAI)
curl "http://localhost:4000/ai/generate?type=music&difficulty=easy"
```
