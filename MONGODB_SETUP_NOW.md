5. **Click**: "Create Deployment" (bottom right)
6. **Wait**: Cluster creation takes ~2-3 minutes

### 🎯 Step 3: Create Database User
**While cluster is creating**, you'll see a modal:

1. **Username**: Choose a username (e.g., `ailivechallengeuser`)
2. **Password**: Click "Auto-generate secure password" OR create your own
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Copy this password! You'll need it.
   - If auto-generated, click "Copy" button
3. **Click**: "Create Database User"
4. **Click**: "Next" on the modal

### 🎯 Step 4: Whitelist IP Address
**Security settings**:

1. **Click**: "Add My Current IP Address" (green button)
2. **OR**: Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (for development)
   - Click "Add Entry"
   - Click "Finish and Close"
3. **✅ Result**: Your database is ready!

### 🎯 Step 5: Get Connection String
**You should be in the cluster overview**:

1. **Click**: The green "Connect" button (top right of cluster)
2. **Select**: "Connect your application" (middle option)
3. **Copy**: The connection string
   - Looks like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
4. **⚠️ Replace**: `<password>` with your database user password
   - Example: `mongodb+srv://ailivechallengeuser:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

- Refresh the page

### "Cluster name exists"
- Choose a different name

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Google Sign-in**: Faster than email verification
2. **Save password**: Use a password manager to save database user password
3. **Allow from anywhere**: For development, use 0.0.0.0/0 (not for production!)
4. **Free tier**: M0 FREE gives you 512MB - plenty for development
