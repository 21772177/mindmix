  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"pass1234"}' \
  | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*' | cut -d'"' -f4)

# 2. Create a group
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/groups/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Test Group",
    "challengeType": "music",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  }'

# 3. Get group details
